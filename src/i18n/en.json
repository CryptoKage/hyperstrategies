    "q3_answer": "When you request a withdrawal from a strategy, a request is created to move your 'Tradable Capital' back to your main 'Available to Allocate' balance. This process can take up to 24 hours to complete. To withdraw funds from the platform to an external wallet, you must use the 'Withdraw Funds' feature on the Wallet page after your strategy withdrawal has been processed. That process should only take minutes."
