    "q1_title": "What are Bonus Points?",
    "q1_answer": "Bonus Points are our way of rewarding users who allocate capital to our vaults. When you allocate funds to a vault, a portion of that capital is converted into Bonus Points, valued at a 1:1 ratio with USDC. This helps cover the platform's operational and development costs, allowing us to build a better service for you.",
    "q2_title": "Can I withdraw my Bonus Points?",
    "q2_answer": "Bonus Points are not directly withdrawable. They represent your contribution to the platform. Over time, as our platform generates revenue from performance fees, we will use a portion of that revenue to \"buy back\" Bonus Points from users. This process converts your Bonus Points back into USDC, which is then added to your main \"Available to Allocate\" balance.",
    "q3_title": "How are vault withdrawals processed?",
    "q3_answer": "When you request a withdrawal from a vault, a request is created to move your \"Tradable Capital\" back to your main \"Available to Allocate\" balance. This process can take a minimum of 48 hours to complete. To withdraw funds from the platform to an external wallet, you must use the \"Withdraw Funds\" feature on the Wallet page after your vault withdrawal has been processed."
